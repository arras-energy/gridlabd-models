PG&E Taxonomy Feeder Models
---------------------------

This information was made publicly available by the California Energy Commission (CEC) and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) pursuant to a computer modeling project undertaken by PG&E and financed by the CEC under Contract # 500-11-018.  The project modeled the potential voltage impacts to postulated types of electric distribution circuits as hypothetical amounts of photovoltaic systems increase.  This work was conducted from October 2012 to March 2015.   Under the modeling activities for the project PG&Eâ€™s CYME-based feeder models were translated into GridLAB-D file format using an open-source Python scripting language.  No private customer data is contained in the information being made available.  This information was made available without any warranty of any kind.

The original data is available on SourceForge at https://sourceforge.net/p/gridlab-d/code/HEAD/tree/Taxonomy_Feeders/PGE_Models/.
