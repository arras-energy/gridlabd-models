Taxonomy Feeder Network Models
------------------------------

The taxonomy feeder network models are static GridLAB-D versions of the DOE Modern Grid Initiative taxonomy of North America Feeders. They do not include any features which would cause the clock to advanced. In particular,

1. All devices controls are set to `MANUAL`.

2. No recorders, players, schedules, or climate objects are included.

3. No clock directive is included.

Caveat: the models generate warnings of various kinds.
